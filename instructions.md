# Autodupe instructions
**YOU WILL NEED TO BUILD YOUR OWN SETUP**

Step 1: Sit in first minecart (closest to donkeys) and type ;dupe startMinecart x,y,z (use tab to auto complete the position & make sure its correct)

Step 2: Go to the last minecart in the chain and do the same but with ;dupe returnMinecart

Step 3: Press f3 and look directly at the reset button. In the f3 menu is Looking at: x y z. Run ;dupe resetButton x,y,z (putting in the coords from looking at in f3 menu)

Step 4: Do the same with the kill button, but by running ;dupe gasButton x,y,z instead

Step 5: Config the module, defaults should work but you may want to shorten the next dupe wait as it is default at 200s. (this setting was to bypass relog bans, they don't exist anymore)

Step 6: Config Lambda's packet cancel by Canceling CPacketPlayer and CPacketInput. Do not turn it on.

Step 7: Get in the first minecart and enable the autodupe module.

Step 8: Become a dupe griefer.
